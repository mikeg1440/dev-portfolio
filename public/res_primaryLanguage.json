      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Michael G. Full Stack coder, a passionate freelancer bringing you programming and design from the future. I am experienced in developing web and desktop applications including full front end design. This includes brand identity, graphics and illustrations. I'm working with newest front-end and Web3 frameworks like React and ethers.js.  The single most important skill of any developer is knowing how to solve problems. From understanding how best to implement a design, fixing bugs as they occur, figuring out how to get the front-end code working together with back-end code, development is about creative problem solving. There are a number of tools and platforms like WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal that you can use for developing a websites front-end, and figuring out which tools are the best fit for particular tasks marks the difference between developing a broken website and a well-designed, scalable one. We have tried to make learning front-end web development as easy as possible, but chances are that you are still going to be stuck because you did not figure something out, or because a piece of code simply does not work.",
